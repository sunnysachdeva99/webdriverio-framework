<h2>JavaScript Class Method</h2>

<p>Demonstration of how to add a method in a JavaScript Class.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
//Use the keyword class to create a class, and always add the constructor() method.
//The constructor method is called each time the class object is initialized.

class Car {
  constructor(brand) {
    this.carname = brand;
  }
  present(x) {
    return x + "I have a " + this.carname;
  }
//Static methods are defined on the class itself, and not on the prototype.
//That means you cannot call a static method on the object (mycar), but on the class (Car):
 static hello() {
    return "Hello!!";
  }
}

mycar = new Car("Ford");
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = Car.hello();
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = mycar.present("Hello ");
